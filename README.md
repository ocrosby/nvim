# NeoVim

My personal neovim settings.

Neovim is a customizable text and code editor based on the Vim text editor. 
Neovim aims to provide Vim’s fast and
versitile user experience, but with enhanced extensibility, usability and 
features.

## Getting Started 

Getting started with a custom neovim configuration is difficult. Looking 
through the various tutorials and articles out there I found that none did 
a good job of explaining what all this lua configuration junk was about, 
until I found [Neovim for Newbs](https://typecraft.dev/neovim-for-newbs). I 
would strongly recommend that anyone interested in customizing neovim read 
through that article and watch the videos that are linked in it. It is a great 
introduction to neovim configuration in lua.

## How is Neovim different from Vim?

While Neovim is built as an extension of Vim, it has a few key differences:

- Neovim uses Lua for its code interface, while Vim uses Vimscript.
- Neovim requires installation, while Vim is installed by default on most Unix systems.
- Neovim includes all features from the start, while Vim has optional features.
- Both Neovim and Vim offer robust plugin support, though Neovim has an enhanced graphical user interface (GUI) ecosystem and a more active development community.
- Both Neovim and Vim have plugins that are compatible with each other, though both also have plugins that are only Neovim-compatible or only Vim-compatible.

## Prerequisites

### RipGrep

```shell
brew install ripgrep
```

## Setup

Backing up a previous config

```shell
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
```


```shell
brew install neovim
```

While editing `.config/nvim/init.lua`, you can use the following command to reload the configuration:

```shell
:source ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

or if you have the `~/.config/nvim/init.load` file open you can

```shell
:source %
```

The result will be that nvim will reload its configuration.


1. The init.lua file

The convention is that it goes in `'~.config/nvim/init.lua`
nvim will automatically load this file

2. Choose an install package manager (lazy.nvim)
3. Install our first package (Colorscheme)
4. Fuzzy finding file and grepping through your codebase (Telescope)
5. Highlighting and indenting (Treesitter)


The repository contains a file `init.lua`. This is the main configuration file that is needed.  In addition, there are a few other files. To use this configuration, you would copy all these files into your `nvim` directory.

## Resetting Plugins for Lazy.nvim

If you want to reset the plugins for lazy.nvim, you can do so by running the following commands:

```shell
# Delete the lazy directory inside ~/.local/share/nvim:
# Optionally, you can also clear the ~/.local/state/nvim directory, which may store additional state data:
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy && rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
```

Restart Neovim. Lazy.nvim will detect the missing data and re-install the plugins automatically.

## Components

### [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)

The goal of nvim-treesitter is both to provide a simple and easy way to use the interface for tree-sitter in Neovim and to provide some basic functionality such as highlighting based on it.
